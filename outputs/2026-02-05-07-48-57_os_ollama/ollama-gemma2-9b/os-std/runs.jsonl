Try using the full path to the 'group' command if you know where it's located.\\n\\n**Solutions:**\\n1. **Install `util-linux`:**\\n   * Open your terminal.\\n   * Use the appropriate package manager for your distribution:\\n      * **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install util-linux`\\n      * **Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:** `sudo yum install util-linux`\\n2. **Check your PATH environment variable:**\\n   * The `PATH` variable tells your shell where to look for commands. Make sure the directory containing the 'group' command is included in your `PATH`. You can edit your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file to add the necessary path.\\n3. **Use the full path:**\\n   * If you know the exact location of the 'group' command, you can run it using its full path:\\n      * For example: `/usr/bin/group`\" }"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No executable tool calls found.
